# .dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, maybe you don't use my setup but you find something of interest here

What I do for setup my mac:

1. Cambiar tecla "tab" por la de control --> General, teclado, teclas modificaci√≥n.
2. Run the install script

If I make some other config I'll add it here.

PENDING: add rsync for my external hard drive
