# .dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, maybe you don't use my setup but you find something of interest here.

What I do for setup my mac:

## Mac specific

For the keyboard:

```
System preferences --> Keyboard
    --> Change the "wait for repetition" for the shortest value.
    --> In keys change tab by control.
```

## install.sh

This script installs the programs I use and my config.

## Private things

If there is something private I need to add from an zsh script the `~/.config/private.zsh` is sourced if exists.

You can apply this same system for private configurations like env vars, ssh keys, etc.
